A FlickOS program is one part of a desktop that has three layouts, two styles,
a live session and an installed system. These rules keep it working, and
findable, in all of them.

## Finding it

### INT-1 Must: A program people open has a desktop file

Anything a user opens by name (a window, a sheet shown on request) has a
`.desktop` file in `/usr/share/applications/`, so fuzzel, the start menu and
Settings' search find it.

| Key | Rule |
|---|---|
| `Name` | Title Case, what the window is called ([TXT-2](/docs/hig/05-writing/#txt-2-must-title-case-for-names-sentence-case-for-everything-else)): `Settings`, `Keyboard Shortcuts` |
| `GenericName` | Only when `Name` doesn't say what it is |
| `Comment` | One sentence in sentence case, no final period, saying what the user can do: `Show the keyboard shortcuts (or hold the Super key)` |
| `Icon` | A freedesktop icon name that Numix-Circle has ([VIS-6](/docs/hig/06-visual-style/#vis-6-must-icons-come-from-the-icon-theme-by-standard-name)) |
| `Categories` | `Settings;DesktopSettings;` for settings, `System;` for system tools |
| `Keywords` | The words people type for it, including the words other desktops use (`hotkeys`, `control;center`) |
| `Exec` | The program and, if needed, its subcommand (`flickos-shortcuts show`) |
| `Terminal`, `StartupNotify` | `false` |

The file name is the Wayland app id ([INT-2](#int-2-should-the-wayland-app-id-is-the-desktop-file-name)).

**Don't:** give a daemon, a helper or a command-line-only tool a desktop file.
They aren't things people open.

### INT-2 Should: The Wayland app id is the desktop file name

Set `GLib.set_prgname(APP_ID)` before GTK starts, with `APP_ID` the desktop
file name without `.desktop`. labwc window rules, the dock's pins and the
taskbar match windows to apps by it. `flickos-control` does this in
`load_gtk()`.

### INT-3 Must: Every entry in the labwc menu is in both menus

The live menu (`flickos-installer`) is the installed menu (`flickos-settings`)
plus *Install FlickOS* and a separator. Change both in the same commit.
`tools/check-menus.py`, run by `build-iso.sh`, fails otherwise.

### INT-4 Must: Every setting can be found from Settings

A user-facing setting has a row on a Settings page (`flickos-control`), or a
tile on *More Settings* when another app owns it. The row's words, plus an
entry in `SEARCH_KEYWORDS` for a new page or tile, make it findable from the
search box. A test checks that every page and tile has keywords.

A setting that only exists on the command line or in a config file is fine for
experts, but it isn't a user-facing setting until it is in Settings.

### INT-5 Must: A new keybinding shows on the shortcut sheet

A key added to labwc (in `flickos-settings`' `rc.xml` or in a program's own
labwc fragment) gets a description in `flickos-shortcuts`' `COMMANDS` or
`ACTIONS`, so holding Super lists it. Before taking a key, check the sheet
(`flickos-shortcuts list`) and the keys of the desktop the layout copies. Use
Super for desktop actions. Leave Ctrl and Alt combinations to apps.

## Every layout, every style, every session

### INT-6 Must: It works in all three layouts and both styles

Test a change in Redmond (bottom panel), Cupertino (top bar and a dock that
auto-hides over windows) and Traditional (top panel and window list), in the
Dark and the Light style. Things that break:

- A layer-shell surface (menu, sheet) anchored to the wrong edge, or covering
  the panel. Read the corner from the layout (`Menu=`, the `menu/anchor` file),
  don't assume the bottom left.
- Colors that are right in Dark and unreadable in Light
  ([VIS-2](/docs/hig/06-visual-style/#vis-2-must-follow-the-style-that-is-in-use)).
- Window buttons: Cupertino puts them on the left.

### INT-7 Must: The live session and the installed system each get what fits them

The live session (`boot=live` on the kernel command line) is for trying
FlickOS and installing it. Nothing done in it is kept.

- **Left out in the live session:** first-login windows, the *Login*, *Users* and
  *Updates* pages, idle locking, anything that only makes sense on an installed
  system. Check with `boot=live` in `/proc/cmdline` (see `live_system()` in
  `flickos-welcome`), and hide the page or card (`available()` returns false),
  don't show it disabled.
- **Only in the live session:** *Install FlickOS* and anything else for the
  installer, in `flickos-installer`, which Calamares removes on install.

### INT-8 Must: Only one window opens at first login

A new account's first login opens exactly one window: `flickos-welcome`.
Something new that a new user should see goes in as a card in it
(`CARDS`), not as another window from autostart.

## Starting and running

### INT-9 Must: New features are opt-in and run nothing while off

A new desktop feature keeps today's behavior as the default. It is turned on
with a switch in Settings, which runs the owning command's `set`
([SET-2](/docs/hig/03-settings-and-files/#set-2-must-cli-first-every-setting-is-a-command)).
While it is off:

- no process runs (no daemon waiting to be told it is on),
- nothing is generated in `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/flickos/`,
- no keybinding or panel module points at it.

Example: `flickos-menu`. While the apps button is fuzzel, no `flickos-menu`
process exists, there is no `menu/anchor` file, and the Super keybinds aren't
in the rc.xml overlay. `flickos-layout launcher set menu` creates all of them
and starts the daemon, and `set fuzzel` removes them again.

**The one exception: keeping a record.** A feature that runs no process,
generates nothing in the overlay, binds nothing and changes no behavior, and
only keeps a record of what the user does, may be on by default. It still has
a switch in Settings, and turning it off also deletes what it kept. The reason
is that a record started only after someone needs it is empty. The History
page is the one case so far: the owners append a line to
`~/.local/state/flickos/history.jsonl` when a setting changes, and nothing
else runs ([design](https://github.com/dvbondoy/FlickOS/blob/main/docs/design/flickos-history.md#adr-007-on-by-default-with-a-switch-to-turn-it-off)).

**Making a shipped feature the default.** A feature that has shipped opt-in
may later become the default, as a decision of its own: an ADR in its design
document that states what it then costs every session. It keeps its switch in
Settings, and everything above still holds while a user has it off. The start
menu is the one case so far: since flickos-layouts 1.23 the apps button opens
it unless the user chose the app launcher, for about 35 MB of private memory
and no CPU while idle
([design](https://github.com/dvbondoy/FlickOS/blob/main/docs/design/flickos-menu.md#adr-010-on-by-default)).

### INT-10 Must: Login programs start from FlickOS's autostart and stay single

A program that runs for the whole session is started by `flickos-settings`'
`/usr/libexec/flickos/autostart`, not by an XDG autostart entry (those are
the user's, handled by `flickos-control startup run`). It:

- runs once per session: a lock in `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/flickos/` (`daemon.lock`,
  `shortcuts.lock`) makes a second copy exit at once,
- doesn't hold up the others: autostart starts it in the background, and it
  waits for a shared lock at most a few seconds (`LOCK_SECONDS` in
  `flickos-layout`),
- exits when the compositor goes away.

### INT-11 Should: Panel programs run under the supervisor

A program that is part of the panel (a bar, the dock, the menu daemon) is
started by `flickos-layout panel` under `flickos-layout supervise`, which
restarts it after a crash and writes its output to
`$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/flickos/panel.log`. Nothing else restarts panel programs,
and the session's own output goes nowhere a user can read.

### INT-12 Should: Notify only when there is no window to show it in

Use a notification (`notify-send -a NAME -i ICON`) for the result of
something that has no window: a key (Super+T turns tiling on), a background
job. When the user did something in a window, show the result in that window
([WIN-10](/docs/hig/04-windows/#win-10-must-show-results-and-errors-where-the-user-is-looking)).
Don't notify just to confirm what the user can already see.
