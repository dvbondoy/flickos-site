When something fails, first read the **end of `build.log`** (or the CI log).
The first `E:` or `P: … failed` line usually tells you why.

```sh
grep -n -E '^E:|failed|error' build.log | head
```

## Building packages

**`Missing repository public key. Run repo/new-key.sh first.`**
The keyring package has no key file. Run `repo/new-key.sh` on your machine. If
the key already exists in your `~/.gnupg`, re-export it instead:
`gpg --armor --export FINGERPRINT > packages/flickos-archive-keyring/keyrings/flickos-archive-keyring.asc`.

**`dpkg-checkbuilddeps: error: unmet build dependencies: debhelper-compat (= 13)`**
`sudo apt install debhelper`.

**`dpkg-checkbuilddeps: error: unmet build dependencies: build-essential:native`**
`sudo apt install build-essential`. `dpkg-dev` pulls it in only as a
Recommends, so it's missing after `apt-get install --no-install-recommends`
(as in CI).

**`dpkg-checkbuilddeps: error: unmet build dependencies: meson … libgtk-layer-shell-dev …`** (while building `sfwbar`)
The build host lacks `sfwbar`'s compilers and headers, the only FlickOS
package with C code. Install the last group of the tool list in
[02](/docs/02-building-and-testing/), or `sudo apt install` exactly what the error
names.

**`dh: command not found` / `dpkg-buildpackage: command not found`**
`sudo apt install debhelper dpkg-dev`.

**`debian/rules: Permission denied`**
`chmod +x packages/*/debian/rules`. In git: `git update-index --chmod=+x packages/NAME/debian/rules`.

**`dh_install: … missing files`**
A source path in `debian/install` doesn't exist. Paths are relative to the
package folder (`packages/NAME/`). Check spelling and that the file is committed.

**`dpkg-parsechangelog` / `dch` errors about the changelog format**
The changelog is whitespace-sensitive. The sign-off line starts with exactly
one space and ` -- `, and there are **two** spaces between the email and the date.
Restore it with `git checkout packages/NAME/debian/changelog` and use `dch`.

## Building the ISO

**`lb: command not found`**
`sudo apt install live-build`.

**Build seems to skip your change**
Stage files in `.build/` say that stage is already done. Use `tools/build-iso.sh`,
which always cleans first.

**An option removed from `auto/config` still takes effect**
The generated `config/common` etc. still have it. `sudo lb clean` (which runs
`auto/clean`) deletes them. Then run `lb config` again.

**`E: You need to install wget on your host system.`**
`sudo apt install wget`. Needed by the firmware step.

**`E: Unable to locate package NAME`** (during chroot stage)
- Typo, or the package doesn't exist in trixie. Check https://packages.debian.org/trixie/NAME.
- If it's in `contrib`/`non-free`, check `--archive-areas` in `auto/config`.
- If it's a FlickOS package: `config/packages.chroot/` is empty or stale, so run
  `sh packages/build.sh`.

**`… has unmet dependencies` / `Depends: X but it is not going to be installed`**
Usually a package name that changed between Debian releases, or conflicting
packages. Try it in a trixie container:
`docker run --rm -it debian:trixie sh -c "apt update && apt install -s PACKAGE"`.

**Failure in `0050-flickos-recommends.hook.chroot`**
One of `flickos-desktop`'s Recommends can't be installed (typo or missing
package). The apt error above it names the package. Fix `debian/control`, bump
the version, rebuild the packages.

**`sanity: these required packages are not installed: …`**
A package the image needs wasn't installed, usually because it is only
*Recommended* by another package and the build uses `--apt-recommends false`.
Add it to a file in `config/package-lists/`. The check lives in
`config/hooks/normal/0010-sanity.hook.chroot`.

**`trim-firmware: removing … would also remove: …`**
Debian reorganised its firmware packages, and removing one on the trim list
would now take another package with it. Check what the named package contains
(`apt-cache show NAME`). If it's also useless on amd64 desktops, add it to `TRIM`
in `config/hooks/normal/0060-trim-firmware.hook.chroot`. Otherwise remove the
package that depends on it from `TRIM`.

**A device works in other live ISOs but not in FlickOS (no Wi-Fi, no GPU acceleration)**
Its firmware may have been trimmed. On the machine, `sudo dmesg | grep -i firmware`
shows `failed to load` lines with the file name. Find the package with
`apt-file search FILENAME` on a Debian machine. If it's on the `TRIM` list in
`0060-trim-firmware.hook.chroot`, remove it from the list and rebuild.

**`apt update` fails at the end of the chroot stage: `404 Not Found`, `Could not resolve`, `NO_PUBKEY`, `The repository … is not signed`**
This is the FlickOS repository from
`packages/flickos-archive-keyring/etc/apt/sources.list.d/flickos.sources`:
- `Could not resolve` / 404: the repository isn't uploaded (run
  `repo/publish.sh && repo/upload.sh`), or the URL is wrong. Open
  https://dvbondoy.github.io/flickos-apt/dists/trixie/InRelease in a browser.
- `NO_PUBKEY` / `not signed` / `invalid signature`: the key in
  `flickos-archive-keyring` doesn't match the key reprepro signs with. Compare
  `gpg --show-keys packages/flickos-archive-keyring/keyrings/flickos-archive-keyring.asc`
  with `SignWith:` in `repo/conf/distributions`. Then `reprepro -b repo export` and `repo/upload.sh`.
- To build while offline or before the repository exists, temporarily add the
  line `Enabled: no` to `flickos.sources`. **Don't release an ISO built like
  that**: installed systems would never get FlickOS updates.

**`repo/upload.sh`: `Permission denied (publickey)`**
GitHub doesn't know your SSH key. Add it at https://github.com/settings/keys
(or `gh auth login`, choosing SSH) and test with `ssh -T git@github.com`. The
account needs write access to `dvbondoy/flickos-apt`.

**`apt update`: `Hash Sum mismatch` on the FlickOS repository right after `repo/upload.sh`**
GitHub Pages' CDN can serve old index files for up to 10 minutes after a push.
Wait and run `apt update` again.

**`tools/upload-release.sh`: `Permission denied (publickey)`**
SourceForge doesn't know your SSH key, or it isn't active yet (can take a few
minutes). Check https://sourceforge.net/auth/shell_services and test with
`sftp dvbondoy@frs.sourceforge.net`. A different account: `SF_USER=name tools/upload-release.sh`.

**`build-iso.sh`: `Version mismatch`**
`FLICKOS_VERSION` in `packages/flickos-branding/usr/lib/flickos-release` and
`version:` in the installer's `branding.desc` differ. Update both
([06](/docs/06-ci-and-releases/#the-version-number)).

**CI: `Tag vX.Y doesn't match FLICKOS_VERSION`**
The tag must be `v` + the version in `flickos-release`. Delete the tag
(`git push --delete origin vX.Y; git tag -d vX.Y`), fix the version or tag, and push again.

**`mount: … permission denied` / chroot errors**
You didn't run `lb build` with `sudo`. In a container, it must be `--privileged`.

**Build breaks halfway and later builds fail oddly (`device busy`, leftover mounts)**
```sh
sudo lb clean --purge
mount | grep "$(pwd)/chroot"        # anything still mounted?
sudo umount -R "$(pwd)/chroot/proc" "$(pwd)/chroot/sys" "$(pwd)/chroot/dev" 2>/dev/null
sudo lb clean --purge
```
Rebooting also clears stuck mounts.

**`umount: …/chroot/sys: target is busy`** (after `lb chroot_sysfs remove`)
A process started by a hook is still running inside the chroot. Find it with
`sudo sh -c 'for p in /proc/[0-9]*; do readlink $p/root | grep -q /chroot && echo ${p#/proc/} $(tr "\0" " " < $p/cmdline); done'`
and `sudo kill` it, then `sudo umount chroot/sys` and resume with `sudo lb build`.
It used to be a `gpg-agent --homedir /tmp/ostree-gpg-…` that `flatpak remote-add`
left behind; `0150-flathub.hook.chroot` now kills it. A new hook that starts a
daemon must stop it too.

**Disk full**
`cache/` and `chroot/` are big. `sudo lb clean --purge` frees everything.

**`Palette check failed: … is not in the Arc-Dark palette`** (at the start of `build-iso.sh`)
A config file uses a color outside FlickOS's Arc-Dark palette, often a leftover
from before Arc or a typo. Use the palette color it should be (see
[09 – The Arc-Dark palette](/docs/09-customizing/#the-arc-dark-palette)). If the color
is intentional and new, add it with a comment to `tools/check-palette.py`.

**`unknown labwc theme key '…'`**
The key is misspelled or doesn't exist in this labwc version; labwc would ignore
it silently. Compare with `man labwc-theme`, and update `LABWC_KEYS` in
`tools/check-palette.py` only when labwc really added the key.

**GTK apps are Arc-Dark, but some app looks light / like Adwaita**
It's a libadwaita app, which ignores GTK themes by design. Nothing to fix in FlickOS.

## Boot test (`tools/boot-test.py`)

Start with `boot-test/serial.log`. It has everything the guest printed. Run
with `--verbose` to watch it live.

**Exit 2: `xorriso not found` / `qemu-system-x86_64 not found`**
`sudo apt install xorriso qemu-system-x86`.

**Exit 2: `could not find a live boot entry`**
The ISO has no `/isolinux/live.cfg` or `/boot/grub/grub.cfg` in the expected
format. Check `--bootloaders` in `auto/config`, and look inside the ISO with
`xorriso -indev FlickOS-64bit-v2.0.iso -ls /isolinux/ /boot/grub/`.

**Exit 3: timed out waiting for `login: `**
Read the end of `serial.log`:
- Ends in the kernel or initramfs (e.g. `Unable to find a medium containing a
  live file system`): a live-boot problem. The kernel and initrd may not match
  the squashfs, so rebuild with `tools/build-iso.sh --purge`.
- Ends in a `(initramfs)` shell prompt: same as above.
- systemd was still starting units: the machine is slow (no KVM?). Try
  `--timeout 1200`.
- Empty log: QEMU didn't start. Run the `qemu-system-x86_64` command by hand
  to see its error.

**Exit 3: `login failed`**
- Most likely the live user doesn't exist: see *Authentication failure* under
  [Live session / installed system](#live-session--installed-system).
- Otherwise the user or password changed: check `username=` in
  `--bootappend-live` and `LIVE_USER`/`LIVE_PASSWORD` at the top of `boot-test.py`.

**`WARN systemd: degraded`**
A unit failed. The failed units are listed below the warning. Look at them in a
live session: `systemctl status UNIT`, `journalctl -b -u UNIT`. Units that
don't apply in VMs are common, so decide per unit whether to fix, mask or ignore it.

**`FAIL labwc running` (or waybar/mako/PipeWire)**
The graphical session on tty1 didn't start. Look at `screen.png`, then boot
with `tools/test-iso.sh`, switch to tty2 and investigate (see *Live session*
below). PipeWire and waybar depend on labwc, so if labwc fails, those fail too.

**`FAIL panel and notifications supervised, neither restarted`** (or *no panel
program crashed during the layout and style switches*)
A panel program failed at least once. The check prints the lines it found in
`$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/flickos/panel.log`, which say which program and why; the
supervisor restarted it, so `screen.png` may well show a normal desktop. A
failure that prints nothing is the other half of the check: waybar or mako is
not a child of `flickos-layout`, so nothing would restart it (an older
flickos-layouts in the image, or autostart starting waybar itself because
flickos-layouts is missing).

**`FAIL network reachable`**
QEMU's user networking has no internet, e.g. a proxy or firewall in CI. It can
also mean NetworkManager didn't configure the interface: check `nmcli` in a live session.

**`screen.png` missing**
The screenshot is best-effort through QMP. It's never a test failure.

## CI

**Workflow doesn't start**
The file must be at `.github/workflows/iso.yml` on the pushed branch, and Actions
must be enabled in the repo settings.

**Boot test much slower in CI, with a *running without KVM* warning**
The runner didn't expose `/dev/kvm` to the container. The test still works,
with longer timeouts. If it times out anyway, pass a larger `--timeout` in the
workflow's *Boot test* step.

**`Permission denied` on a script in CI but works locally**
The executable bit isn't committed. See [06](/docs/06-ci-and-releases/#requirements-for-ci-to-pass).

**Release step fails with `403` / `Resource not accessible by integration`**
Repo Settings → Actions → General → Workflow permissions → **Read and write**.

## Apt repository

**`reprepro: … already registered with different checksums`**
You rebuilt a package with changes but the same version. Bump it (`dch -i -D trixie "…"`).

**`gpg: signing failed: Inappropriate ioctl for device`**
gpg can't show the passphrase prompt. Run `export GPG_TTY=$(tty)` and retry.
Add it to your shell rc file.

**`gpg: signing failed: No secret key`**
The secret key isn't on this machine. Import your backup:
`gpg --import flickos-archive-secret.asc`.

**Users don't receive an update**
1. Version bumped? `dpkg-parsechangelog -l packages/NAME/debian/changelog -S Version`
2. Published and uploaded? `curl -fsSL URL/dists/trixie/main/binary-amd64/Packages | grep -A1 "Package: NAME"`
3. On the user system: `sudo apt update && apt policy NAME`
4. If it's a *new* entry in `flickos-desktop`'s `Recommends:`, installed systems
   won't install it. See [04](/docs/04-packages/#flickos-desktop-meta-package).

## Live session / installed system

**Live session: `flickos login: user (automatic login)` then `Authentication failure`**
The live user was never created, so there is nothing to log into. live-config
creates it only when the **`user-setup`** package is installed, and that package
is merely *recommended* by live-config while the image is built with
`--apt-recommends false`. It must therefore be listed in
`config/package-lists/live.list.chroot`. Check an ISO with:

```sh
grep -c '^Setting up user-setup' build.log      # 1 = installed
```

The same applies to any other package's Recommends
([03](/docs/03-live-build-config/#autoconfig-build-options)).

**Black screen or labwc doesn't start in QEMU**
Use `-device virtio-vga`. To see the error, switch to tty2 (in the QEMU window
send Ctrl+Alt+F2; autologin is on there in the live session) and run `labwc`
by hand to read its output. If it's a GPU/renderer error, try
`WLR_RENDERER=pixman labwc`.

**Installed system: text login prompt instead of the login screen**
The login screen (`flickos-greeter`) didn't start. Log in on tty1, which starts
the desktop as before, then check in foot:
- `systemctl status greetd` and `journalctl -b -u greetd`. systemd restarts
  greetd up to 5 times in 30 s, then gives up.
- `readlink /etc/systemd/system/display-manager.service` should point to
  `greetd.service`. Another display manager there wins; `sudo systemctl enable
  --force greetd` switches back.
- `cat /run/flickos-greetd/config.toml`: written by `greetd-config` before each
  start. Missing means the drop-in didn't run (`systemctl cat greetd` shows it).
- The greeter's own errors (cage, gtkgreet) are in the journal too. For a
  GPU/renderer error, try `WLR_RENDERER=pixman` in the `greeter` script.
- Upgraded systems switch to the login screen only after a reboot.

**Installed system: logging in at the login screen returns to it**
The session exited right away. Log in on tty1 (Ctrl+Alt+F1) to see
`flickos-session`'s errors, or run `flickos-session` from a text console.
`~/.profile` is read before the session starts (greetd sources it), so an
error or an `exec` there can end the login too.

**Installed system: automatic login doesn't happen**
`getent group autologin` must list the user (first member wins); greetd logs
them in once per boot, not after logging out. Add them with
`sudo gpasswd -a USER autologin`.

**Installed system: tty1 shows a login prompt but labwc doesn't start after login**
- `ls /etc/profile.d/95-flickos-session.sh /usr/bin/flickos-session`: is
  `flickos-settings` installed?
- The script only runs on **tty1** and only in a login shell.
- Run `flickos-session` by hand to see errors.

**User changed labwc settings but FlickOS updates don't apply**
They have their own copy in `~/.config/labwc/`, which wins over `/etc/xdg/labwc/`.
Expected. See [04](/docs/04-packages/#flickos-settings).

**"Install FlickOS" does nothing / Calamares doesn't open**
Run `flickos-install -d` in foot to see Calamares's output. Common causes:
- `sudo: a password is required`: the live user's passwordless sudo is missing
  (live-config's `sudo` component didn't run). Check `sudo -n true`.
- Qt can't connect to the display: check `echo $WAYLAND_DISPLAY` in foot, and
  that `qt6-wayland` is installed.
- Calamares's log: `.cache/calamares/session.log` in `/home/user/` or `/root/`.

**"Install FlickOS" is still in the menu after installing**
`flickos-installer` wasn't removed. Check `dpkg -l flickos-installer` on the
installed system, and look for errors from the `packages` job in the Calamares
log. Remove it by hand with `sudo apt purge flickos-installer calamares`.

**Keyboard layout is wrong in the desktop**
Check `cat /etc/default/keyboard`, then log out and in. The session script
(`flickos-session`) and the login screen read it when they start. A user's `~/.config/labwc/environment` with `XKB_DEFAULT_*` values
overrides it.

**No network icon in the panel**
nm-applet must run with `--indicator` (waybar's tray doesn't support old-style
icons), and waybar's config must include `"tray"`. Check `pgrep -a nm-applet`.

**No panel at all (no bar, but the wallpaper and the menu are there)**
The panel, notifications and the dock run under a supervisor
(`flickos-layout supervise`, one per program) that restarts one that fails, so a
missing bar means it failed repeatedly or never started. Everything they print
goes to **`$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/flickos/panel.log`** — the session's stderr goes
nowhere a user can read, so that log is the only trace:

```sh
cat $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/flickos/panel.log     # "restarting it in Ns", "giving up"
pgrep -af 'flickos-layout (panel|supervise)'   # supervisors still running?
pgrep -a waybar; ls $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/flickos/waybar/
```

- `waybar … giving up` after five restarts: the lines above it are waybar's own
  output. A bar that keeps dying right after an output appears or disappears is
  usually the VM's or a second monitor's mode change.
- No `starting the panel` line at all: `flickos-layout panel` never ran (labwc
  didn't start its autostart, or flickos-layouts isn't installed).
- `another flickos-layout has been busy for 10s`: a sibling autostart command
  hung while holding `layout.lock`. The panel carries on without the lock, so
  this is a warning, not the cause.

Start the panel by hand to watch it fail in a terminal:

```sh
waybar -c $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/flickos/waybar/config.jsonc -s $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/flickos/waybar/style.css
```

**Panel is a single top bar (taskbar, clock, status) instead of the chosen layout**
That's flickos-settings' fallback panel: `flickos-layout panel` couldn't generate
the layout's panel. Run `flickos-layout set $(flickos-layout current)` in a
terminal to see the error (JSON syntax in `waybar.jsonc`, a missing `include` or
palette file, or no `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`). `flickos-layout doctor` lists user files
that replace the panel (`~/.config/waybar/config`).

**Tray icons missing after switching layouts**
waybar owns the tray (`StatusNotifierWatcher`). After a restart, applets must
register again, which takes a few seconds. Check
`busctl --user get-property org.kde.StatusNotifierWatcher /StatusNotifierWatcher org.kde.StatusNotifierWatcher RegisteredStatusNotifierItems`.
If an applet never comes back, restart it (`pkill nm-applet; nm-applet --indicator &`).

**Switching to Light (or Dark) didn't change the GTK theme or icons**
`style set` only switches `gtk-theme` and `icon-theme` while they are one of the
styles' themes (`Arc`/`Arc-Dark`, `Numix-Circle`/`Numix-Circle-Light`), so a
theme chosen in *Settings → Appearance* (nwg-look) is kept. `flickos-layout doctor`
names it. Pick Arc or Arc-Dark in Appearance (or
`gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface gtk-theme Arc-Dark`), then choose the
style again. Already open GTK apps usually update live; restart one that doesn't.

**Some apps stay light (or dark) whatever the style: they look like Adwaita**
Those are libadwaita (GTK 4) apps, e.g. GNOME apps. libadwaita ignores GTK
themes by design; it only follows `color-scheme`, which styles do set
(`prefer-dark` for Dark, `default` for Light). Nothing to fix in FlickOS.

**Terminal, launcher or notifications keep the old colors after a style switch**
- Open foot windows keep their colors; new ones get the style's.
- `~/.config/foot/foot.ini`, `~/.config/fuzzel/fuzzel.ini` or
  `~/.config/mako/config` replace FlickOS's config, including the style's colors
  (`flickos-layout doctor` lists them).
- The session started before flickos-layouts 1.3: log out and in, so the
  overlay is in `XDG_CONFIG_DIRS` and mako runs with the generated config
  (`tr '\0' ' ' < /proc/$(pgrep -x mako)/cmdline`).
- Check the generated files: `ls -R $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/flickos/`. With Light there
  are `xdg/foot/foot.ini` and `xdg/fuzzel/fuzzel.ini`; `mako/config` includes
  `styles/ID/mako.conf`.

**Window borders and menus don't follow the style**
labwc takes the window theme from the first `rc.xml`. `~/.config/labwc/rc.xml`
hides the overlay. The overlay also keeps a theme other than `FlickOS-Arc-Dark`
or `FlickOS-Arc` that an administrator set in `/etc/xdg/labwc/rc.xml`. Check
`grep -A1 '<theme>' $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/flickos/xdg/labwc/rc.xml`.

**Desktop Layout & Style does nothing when chosen from the menu**
Run `flickos-layout pick` in a terminal to see why. "already open" means a
chooser window is still open, maybe behind other windows or on another output;
the lock is `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/flickos/pick.lock`. "GTK 3 is not available"
means `python3-gi` or `gir1.2-gtk-3.0` is missing: the chooser then falls back
to a fuzzel list, and without fuzzel only `flickos-layout set ID` works.

**A pinned app is missing from the Cupertino dock**
Apps whose desktop file doesn't exist, has `Hidden=true`, or whose `TryExec`
program isn't installed are skipped. Check `ls /usr/share/applications/ID` and
the `pins =` line in `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/flickos/dock/sfwbar.config`. An app whose
window has a different app id than its desktop file name shows up twice (pin
and window).

**The Cupertino dock doesn't appear**
While the active window is maximized, it is hidden until the pointer touches
the bottom edge right below it (the middle of the screen; in a QEMU window,
fullscreen QEMU with Ctrl+Alt+F so the pointer reaches the last row). `pgrep -a sfwbar` should show one
`sfwbar -f /run/user/…/flickos/dock/sfwbar.config`. If not, run
`flickos-layout set cupertino` in a terminal for errors, then that `sfwbar -f …`
command to see sfwbar's own messages.

**No boot splash, only text during boot**
- `splash` missing from the kernel line: check `cat /proc/cmdline`.
- Wrong theme: `plymouth-set-default-theme` should print `flickos`. Fix with
  `sudo plymouth-set-default-theme -R flickos` (`-R` rebuilds the initramfs).
- In a VM, Plymouth needs a graphics device with a framebuffer. Use
  `-device virtio-vga` (as `tools/test-iso.sh` does).

**Boot menu still says "Live system" or shows Debian's splash**
`config/bootloaders/` wasn't used: check the files exist and are committed, then
rebuild with `tools/build-iso.sh`. In `build.log`, look for the
`binary_syslinux`/`binary_grub_cfg` steps. A black GRUB background usually means
the splash PNG isn't 8-bit RGB (`identify config/bootloaders/grub-pc/splash.png`).

**GRUB boot entry is missing or broken**
A bare placeholder word (e.g. `KERNEL_LIVE`, `MEMTEST`, `LINUX_LIVE`) appears in
`config/bootloaders/grub-pc/grub.cfg` outside `@…@`, even in a comment. See
[09 – Boot menu](/docs/09-customizing/#boot-menu).

**`dpkg-divert: error: 'diversion of /usr/lib/os-release …' clashes`**
Another package diverts the same file. List diversions with `dpkg-divert --list`.
Only one package can divert a file.

**Firewall blocks something (e.g. SSH, KDE Connect, a game server)**
`sudo ufw allow PORT/tcp` (or `/udp`), or temporarily `sudo ufw disable` to confirm
the firewall is the cause. See [09 – Firewall](/docs/09-customizing/#firewall).

**Screen locks or suspends during testing**
swayidle only runs on installed systems (not in the live session). In a test
VM, stop it with `pkill swayidle`.

## Window tiling (flick-tiler)

### How it works, in one paragraph

labwc cannot be told by another program to move or resize a window, so
flick-tiler never does. It tiles through labwc's **regions**: it writes one
region per tiled window, plus a window rule that snaps each new window to the
next unused region, into the fragment
`$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/flickos/tiler/labwc.xml`. `flickos-layout reconfigure` merges
that fragment into the overlay `rc.xml` (`$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/flickos/xdg/labwc/rc.xml`)
and reloads labwc, which then gives every window the new geometry of its
region. So a tiling problem is always in one of four places: the **daemon**,
the **fragment**, the **merge into the overlay**, or **labwc reading the
overlay**. The daemon runs for the whole session, tiling on or off: autostart
starts it at login, and while tiling is off it simply writes no fragment. So
**no daemon at all means something went wrong**, not that tiling is off.
Details in
[09 – Window tiling](/docs/09-customizing/#window-tiling).

### First checks

Run these in a terminal **inside the session** (not over the serial console,
which lacks the session environment):

```sh
flick-tiler status                                  # {"alt": "off"} = tiling is off
pgrep -fa '[f]lick-tiler daemon'                    # exactly one, all session long
ls $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/flickos/tiler/                  # control, daemon.lock, labwc.xml while on
grep -c '<region' $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/flickos/xdg/labwc/rc.xml   # regions that reached labwc
flickos-layout doctor                               # user config that blocks the overlay
dpkg-query -W flick-tiler flickos-layouts flickos-settings
```

Versions must match: flick-tiler 1.1 depends on **flickos-layouts >= 1.8**
(`flickos-layout reconfigure`, the merge into the overlay and the panel button)
and **flickos-settings >= 1.11** (Super+T and the autostart line). flickos-layouts declares
`Breaks: flick-tiler (<< 1.1)`, so apt refuses the broken combination — but a
half-finished upgrade can still leave you with only one of them.

### Symptoms

**Turning tiling on does nothing to the windows already open**
By design: labwc applies window rules only when a window *opens*, so
flick-tiler cannot capture windows that are already there. A notification says
so. Press **Super+Shift+T** in each window you want tiled, or just open a new
window. `flick-tiler status` shows how many windows it manages.

**New windows don't tile at all**
Work down the chain:

```sh
flick-tiler status        # "off" → turn it on (Super+T); no answer → no daemon
pgrep -fa '[f]lick-tiler daemon'
test -e $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/flickos/tiler/labwc.xml && echo fragment ok
grep -c '<region' $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/flickos/xdg/labwc/rc.xml    # 0 → the merge didn't happen
tr '\0' '\n' < /proc/$(pgrep -x labwc)/environ | grep XDG_CONFIG_DIRS
```

- `XDG_CONFIG_DIRS` must start with `<XDG_RUNTIME_DIR>/flickos/xdg`. If it
  doesn't, labwc never reads the overlay and **nothing** the tiler writes has
  any effect. That happens when the session didn't start through
  `flickos-session`, or when `flickos-layout prepare` failed at login.
- A user's own `~/.config/labwc/rc.xml` replaces the whole system file,
  including the overlay: tiling can't work at all. `flickos-layout doctor`
  reports it. Move it away and log in again.
- Regions present but windows still float: run `labwc --reconfigure` by hand,
  then `flick-tiler off && flick-tiler on`.
- No daemon at all: autostart didn't start it (`grep -n flick-tiler
  /usr/libexec/flickos/autostart`), or it stopped. Start one with
  `flick-tiler daemon &` and read its messages; they normally go to the
  session's output (tty1 in the live session, `journalctl -b -u greetd` on an
  installed system).

**The panel button is missing**
- It appears a second or two after login, once waybar has run
  `flick-tiler status` for the first time. A screenshot taken immediately
  after login can miss it.
- `flick-tiler status` must print one line of JSON. If it prints nothing or an
  error, waybar has nothing to show.
- The module lives in flickos-layouts' `layouts/common/modules.jsonc`
  (`custom/tiler`), so it needs flickos-layouts >= 1.8 and it has to be in
  the generated panel: `grep -A8 custom/tiler $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/flickos/waybar/config.jsonc`.
- A user's own `~/.config/waybar/` replaces the FlickOS panel entirely
  (`flickos-layout doctor` reports it), so the button is gone.
- The icon comes from the icon theme (`view-dual-symbolic` and friends in
  `adwaita-icon-theme`). Without it the button is a blank but clickable gap.

**The panel button doesn't follow what the keys do**
flick-tiler tells waybar with `SIGRTMIN+8` (`PANEL_SIGNAL` in `flick-tiler`,
`"signal": 8` in `modules.jsonc`). Test it by hand:

```sh
flick-tiler status; pkill -RTMIN+8 -x waybar      # the icon should match the state
```

If the signal works but nothing changes, the running waybar is using a config
without `"signal": 8` (an old flickos-layouts, or the user's own panel).
Clicking the button always refreshes it, signal or not.

**There are no gaps between the windows**
This cannot be fixed in the current design, and `Gap=` in
`/etc/xdg/flickos/tiler.conf` does nothing. labwc's `<core><gap>` applies only
to *movement actions* such as `MoveToEdge` (`man labwc-config`; in the 0.8.3
source `rc.gap` is read only by `src/snap.c` and `src/view.c`, never by
`src/regions.c`). Regions are also parsed with `atoi`
(`src/config/rcxml.c`), so their geometry is whole percentages of each
output's usable area — a pixel-exact gap can't even be expressed. If gaps
matter, they have to come from a labwc that supports them.

**Tiled terminals leave a few pixels of wallpaper at their edges**
foot resizes in whole character cells, so it cannot fill a region exactly.
Other applications fill their region. Nothing to fix in flick-tiler.

**A window is in the wrong place, or the count is wrong**
Dragging a window out of its place unsnaps it in labwc, and flick-tiler cannot
see that (wlr-foreign-toplevel reports no geometry), so it still counts the
window. Press **Super+Shift+T** to tile it again where it belongs, or
**Super+Shift+F** to let it float on purpose.

**A dialog jumps into a tile for a moment and then floats**
The window rule matches every window, so a dialog is snapped on open and
released immediately after: flick-tiler drops the region again for windows
that have a parent and for the app ids in `Float=`
(`/etc/xdg/flickos/tiler.conf`). Add app ids there (shell patterns, matched
case-insensitively against the Wayland app id) for apps that should never
tile. The app id is normally the name of the app's desktop file without
`.desktop` (`ls /usr/share/applications`), and the WM_CLASS for XWayland apps;
`wlrctl toplevel list` prints the ids of open windows if you install it
(`sudo apt install wlrctl`, not part of FlickOS).

**Windows stay stuck in their tiles although tiling is off**
Only a daemon that died without warning (`kill -9`, a crash, a lost session)
leaves its fragment behind, and labwc then keeps applying the regions. A
normal stop — `off`, `pkill` (TERM), Ctrl+C, logging out — removes the
fragment and reloads labwc first. Either command clears what's left:

```sh
flick-tiler off            # deletes the fragment and reloads labwc
flick-tiler on             # a fresh daemon also clears what the old one left
```

By hand, if flick-tiler itself is gone:

```sh
rm -f $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/flickos/tiler/labwc.xml && flickos-layout reconfigure
```

**`flick-tiler: tiling is off (turn it on with Super+T or flick-tiler on)`**
A command that needs the daemon (`focus`, `swap`, `promote`, `tile`, `float`)
was run while tiling is off. Only `on`, `off`, `toggle`, `mode` and `status`
work without a daemon.

**Super+T does nothing**
That binding is in flickos-settings' `/etc/xdg/labwc/rc.xml`, not in the
fragment, so it works even while tiling is off — unless a user `rc.xml`
replaces it:

```sh
grep -n 'flick-tiler toggle' /etc/xdg/labwc/rc.xml
grep -n 'flick-tiler' $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/flickos/xdg/labwc/rc.xml   # the other keys, only while on
```

The other keys (Super+J/K, Super+M, Super+[ ], Super+Shift+…) exist **only**
while tiling is on, because they are part of the fragment.

**`flick-tiler isn't running; saved for the next login.`**
No daemon answered, so the choice was only written to
`~/.config/flickos/tiler`. Expected from a text console; inside a session it
means the daemon is gone — see *New windows don't tile at all* above. The
daemon needs a Wayland session with `zwlr_foreign_toplevel_manager_v1`
(labwc); anywhere else it exits with *cannot connect to the Wayland
compositor*.

**The Cupertino dock lies on top of tiled windows**
The dock reserves no space (`exclusive_zone = "0"`), and regions cover the
whole usable area, so tiled windows extend under it. Expected with that
layout; the panel (waybar) does reserve space and is never covered.

**Tiling is on again after a reboot (or off although it was on)**
The choice is saved per user in `~/.config/flickos/tiler` and only the system
default is in `/etc/xdg/flickos/tiler.conf`:

```sh
cat ~/.config/flickos/tiler       # [Tiler] Enabled=yes|no, Mode=, MasterRatio=
```

At login, autostart runs `flick-tiler daemon`, which reads that file and
tiles straight away when it says `Enabled=yes`. Setting `Enabled=yes` in
`/etc/xdg/flickos/tiler.conf` turns tiling on for everyone who hasn't chosen.

### The files it uses

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/flickos/tiler/labwc.xml` | The fragment: regions, window rule, keybinds. Gone = tiling off |
| `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/flickos/tiler/control` | The daemon's socket; every command but `status` needs it |
| `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/flickos/tiler/daemon.lock` | Keeps it to one daemon per session |
| `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/flickos/xdg/labwc/rc.xml` | The overlay labwc reads: FlickOS `rc.xml` + the fragment |
| `~/.config/flickos/tiler` | The user's choice (`Enabled`, `Mode`, `MasterRatio`) |
| `/etc/xdg/flickos/tiler.conf` | System defaults, including `Float=` |

Nothing is written to `$HOME` except `~/.config/flickos/tiler`, and the
runtime files are gone after logout.

### Watching it work

Run the daemon in the foreground to see every error as it happens. Only one
daemon runs at a time (the lock), so stop the one from autostart first:

```sh
pkill -f '[f]lick-tiler daemon'            # stop the session's daemon
flick-tiler daemon                         # the same thing in the foreground; Ctrl+C to stop
```

Ctrl+C removes the fragment and reloads labwc, exactly as a normal stop does.
The setting in `~/.config/flickos/tiler` is untouched, so the next login (or
`flick-tiler daemon &`) picks up where you left off.

Two environment variables help while developing: `FLICKOS_LAYOUT` names
the program it calls to merge and reload (`FLICKOS_LAYOUT=true` skips that),
and `FLICK_TILER_PREFIX` points at a source tree, so
`FLICK_TILER_PREFIX=packages/flick-tiler packages/flick-tiler/usr/bin/flick-tiler daemon`
runs the working copy with its own `tiler.conf`.

What labwc actually got:

```sh
grep -o '<region[^/]*/>' $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/flickos/xdg/labwc/rc.xml
sed -n '/<windowRules>/,/<\/windowRules>/p' $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/flickos/xdg/labwc/rc.xml
```

Exit codes: `0` ok, `1` error, `2` wrong usage. `flick-tiler status` prints
`{"alt": "off"}` whenever no daemon answers, whatever the saved setting says.

### Testing a change

```sh
cd packages/flick-tiler && python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v   # also runs at package build
tools/boot-test.py       # checks "tiling off by default…" and "tiling on starts the daemon…"
```

The boot test only proves the plumbing. For behaviour, drive a live VM with
`tools/test-iso.sh --live` and watch the windows, or import `tools/boot-test.py`
from a script, replace its `CHECKS` and let it take screenshots for you.

### Limits that are not bugs

- Windows open before tiling was turned on stay floating (Super+Shift+T).
- No gaps (see above).
- One arrangement for all outputs, and one for all workspaces.
- Two windows opening in the same instant can land in the same tile; open one
  of them again, or press Super+Shift+T in it.
- A window dragged out of its tile keeps counting until it is tiled again or
  closed.

## Shortcut sheet (flickos-shortcuts)

Holding Super shows nothing:

```sh
pgrep -af 'flickos-shortcuts daemon'   # running? autostart starts it
flickos-shortcuts daemon               # in a session terminal: prints why it stops
flickos-shortcuts show                 # the sheet without the daemon
flickos-shortcuts list                 # what it would show
```

- `already running`: another daemon holds `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/flickos/shortcuts.lock`.
- `GTK 3 with layer shell is not available`: `gir1.2-gtklayershell-0.1` is
  missing (a Depends; `sudo apt install flickos-shortcuts`).
- The sheet shows only when **Super alone** is held: with another modifier
  down (Shift, Ctrl, Alt) it waits until that is let go.
- `no labwc rc.xml found`: no `labwc/rc.xml` in `~/.config` or any
  `XDG_CONFIG_DIRS` folder (the sheet says so instead of listing keys).
- A shortcut with a vague description (*Run …*, under *Other*) is a command
  `COMMANDS` doesn't know ([09](/docs/09-customizing/#shortcut-sheet-hold-super)).

## Settings window (flickos-control)

A mouse, touchpad or keyboard setting doesn't apply:

```sh
flickos-control get                                  # what is set, and where (user, system, default)
cat $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/flickos/control/labwc.xml       # the fragment for labwc
grep -A3 '<libinput>' $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/flickos/xdg/labwc/rc.xml   # merged into the overlay?
flickos-layout doctor                                # user files that hide the overlay
```

- A `~/.config/labwc/rc.xml` replaces the whole overlay, so none of these
  settings (nor layouts or tiling) apply; a `~/.config/labwc/environment`
  hides the keyboard layout. `doctor` and the page's warning bar say so.
- Back to the *Device default* click method takes effect at the next login:
  labwc keeps a libinput option that disappears from its config.
- The keyboard layout of the login screen and the console is
  `/etc/default/keyboard`, changed only by *Use for Login Screen and
  Console…*. `localectl set-x11-keymap` doesn't work on Debian (localed is
  read-only there). The console picks it up at the next boot.
- *Use for Login Screen and Console…* (or *Log in automatically*) does nothing: `pkexec` needs the polkit
  agent (mate-polkit, started by autostart) to ask for the password. Try
  `pkexec /usr/libexec/flickos/control-helper keyboard pc105 us "" ""` in a
  terminal to see its message.

Other pages:

- **Super+B or Super+E opens the wrong app:** `xdg-mime query default
  x-scheme-handler/https` (or `inode/directory`) shows the default;
  `/usr/libexec/flickos/open-default browser` falls back to `x-www-browser`
  when the default's desktop file is missing. **Super+Enter:** `DEBUG=1
  xdg-terminal-exec` shows which list and terminal it picks (the first
  installed one in `~/.config/xdg-terminals.list`, then
  `/etc/xdg/flickos/xdg-terminals.list`); a terminal whose `Exec=` isn't
  quoted by the desktop-entry rules (double quotes only) is skipped.
- **The screen locks at the old time:** `pgrep -a swayidle` shows the times;
  a change restarts only FlickOS's swayidle (`FLICKOS_IDLE=1` in its
  environment). Not in the live session.
- **"Set the time automatically" is greyed out:** `timedatectl show -p
  CanNTP` is `no` without `systemd-timesyncd` (a Depends of flickos-desktop
  since 1.16).
- **Login page missing:** it shows only on installed systems with
  flickos-greeter (group `autologin`), never with `boot=live`.
